# Bayes Factor

If we have some data $D$ and two models $M_1$ and $M_2$, and want to know which model is more strongly supported by the data, we can look at a **Bayes factor**.

$$
K = \frac{P(D \vert M_1)}{P(D \vert M_2)} = \frac{P(M_1 \vert D) P(M_2)}{P(M_2 \vert D) P(M_1)}
$$

If the Bayes factor is $K>1$, we say the model $M_1$ is more strongly supported by the data and vice versa for $M_2$.

We often have to use approximations (eg Laplace approximations) if we cannot compute this likelyhood of models. The priors over models usually assumed to be uniform and therefore cancel out.

Useful for model selection as controls for overfitting.
