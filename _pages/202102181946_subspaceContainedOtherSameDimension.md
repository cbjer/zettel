# Subspace Contained Within Another with Same Dimension

If one [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) is contained within another, and they have the same [dimension](202102062253_dimensionDefinition)
then they are equal.
$$
U \subseteq W \, \& \, \textrm{dim} \, U = \textrm{dim} \, W \implies U = W
