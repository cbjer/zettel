# Bias Definition

Bias describes, on average, how far away are we from the true parameter value when we use our [estimator](202012241539_estimatorDefinition) for it.
It is a function mapping the estimator random variable to a real number defined as

$$
\textrm{Bias}(\hat{\theta}) = E(\hat{\theta}) - \theta
$$
where $\theta$ is the true value of the parameter being estimated.

If the bias is $0$, then we say that the estimator is **an unbiased estimator** for $\theta$. That is $\mathrm{E}(\hat{\theta}) = \theta$.
