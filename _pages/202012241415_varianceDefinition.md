# Variance Definition

Variance is a measure of spread of a random variable. We can think of it as a distance measure showing
how far on average are we from the expected (mean) value.

$$
\sigma^2 = E \Big[ \big( X - E(X) \big)^2 \Big] = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
$$

Standard deviation $\sigma$ is the square root of the variance.
