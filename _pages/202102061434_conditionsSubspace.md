# Conditions for a Subspace

A subset $U$ is a [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) if and only if the following 3 conditions hold:

- Additive identity $\quad \mathbf{0} \in U$
- Closed under addition $\quad u, w \in U \implies u + w \in U$
- Closed under scalar multiplication $\quad a \in F, u \in U \implies au \in U$
