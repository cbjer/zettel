# Isometry Definition

An [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $S$ is called an **isometry** if 
$$
\Vert S v \Vert = \Vert v \Vert \\
\textrm{for all} \, v \in V
$$

Ie, an operator is an isometry if it preserves [norms](202102141717_normDefinition)

When being referred to on a real [inner product space](202102141708_innerProductSpace), it is also called an **orthogonal operator**. When
referring to a complex inner product space, a **unitary operator**.

We have the following [equivalences for an isometry](202102201252_equivalencesIsometries)
