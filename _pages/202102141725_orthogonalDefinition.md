# Orthogonal Definition

We say two vector $v, w \in V$ are **orthogonal** if $\langle v, w \rangle = 0$

Ie that the [inner product](202102141654_innerProductDefinition) between them is zero. Can think of the two vectors as perpendicular.

We note that:
- $0$ is orthogonal to every vector in $V$ 
- $0$ is the only vector in $V$ that is orthogonal to itself
