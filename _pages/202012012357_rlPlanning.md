# Planning

Planning for Reinforcment Learning is a process whereby we take a model as input 
and either output a [policy](202011242107_rlPolicy) or improve a given policy. 

The approach we use is technically called **state space planning** 
whereby we search through the state space for an optimal policy.

Very often with planning, can involve using previous experience to generate 
simulated experience which we can then use our same learning methods on. This
has the negative that if the model is incorrect, then we will be learning a sub-optimal policy
with respect to the actual environment.
