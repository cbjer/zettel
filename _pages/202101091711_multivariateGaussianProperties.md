# Multivariate Gaussian Properties

Some useful properties of [Gaussians](202101091649_multivariateNormalDistribution) which make them
very useful to work with are:

- The Sum of [independent](202012241408_independence) Gaussians is Gaussian
- The marginal of a joint Gaussian is Gaussian
- The conditional distribution of a joint Gaussian is Gaussian
