# Degree and Zeros of Characteristic Polynomial

$V$ complex vector space and operator $T$ then:
- the [characteristic polynomial](202104241811_characteristicPolynomialDefinition) of $T$ has degree $\textrm{dim} \, V$
- The zeros of the characteristic polynomial of $T$ are the [eigenvalues](202102120912_eigenvalueDefinition) of $T$.
