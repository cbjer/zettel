# The Matrix of the Product of Linear Maps

If we have $u_1, \ldots, u_n$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ and $w_1, \ldots, w_n$ are all bases of $V$. Then if we have
$S, T$ as operators, then:
$$
\mathcal{M}(ST, (u_1, \ldots, u_n), (w_1, \ldots, w_n)) = \\
\mathcal{M}(S, (v_1, \ldots, v_n), (w_1, \ldots, w_n)) \, \mathcal{M}(T, (u_1, \ldots, u_n), (v_1, \ldots, v_n))
$$

Ie we can break down the operators with a choice of intermediary basis.
