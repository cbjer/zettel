# Null Space Definition

For a [linear map](202102071416_linearMapDefinition) $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, we define 
the **null space** of $T$ as the subset of $V$ which are mapped to $0$ by $T$. Ie
$$
\mathrm{null} \, T = \{ v \in V : Tv = 0 \}
$$

We can easily show that the null space is a [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) of $V$. 

The [dimension](202102062253_dimensionDefinition) of the null space is called the **nullity** of $T$.
