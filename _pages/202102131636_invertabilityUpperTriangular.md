# Invertability of Upper Triangular Matrix 

If the [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T$ has an [upper-triangular](202102131604_upperTriangularMatrix) matrix 
according to some basis, then $T$ is [invertible](202102081851_invertibleMap) if and only if 
all the entries on the diagonal of the matrix are non-zero.

Using that [diagonal entries of an upper triangular method are the eigenvalues](202102131639_eigenvaluesUpperTriangular), we see that, assuming 
we have an upper triangular form, $T$ is invertible if and only if the eigenvalues are non-zero.
