# Leibniz Integral Rule

Identity relating to taking derivatives of integrals:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \Big( \int_{b(x)}^{a(x)} f(x,t) dt \Big) = f(x, b(x)) \frac{d}{dx}b(x) - f(x,a(x)) \frac{d}{dx}a(x) + \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} f(x,t) dt
$$

Note if our bounds are not a function of $x$, we have a very simple form where can just bring the derivative within the integral.
