# Range Definition

For a [linear map](202102071416_linearMapDefinition) $T : V \rightarrow W$, the **range** of $T$ is the subset of $W$ 
consisting of the vectors which are of the form $T v$ for some $v \in V$.
$$
\mathrm{range} \, T = \{ T v : v \in V \}
$$

Easy to show that the range of $T$ is a [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) of $W$.

The [dimension](202102062253_dimensionDefinition) of the range is called the **rank** of $T$.
