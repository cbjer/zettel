# Description of Isometries when $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}$

If we have $V$ a real [inner product space](202102141708_innerProductSpace) and $S$ an operator, then the 
following are equivalent:
- $S$ is an [isometry](202102201248_isometryDefinition)
- There is an [orthonormal basis](202102142105_orthonormalBasisDefinition) of $V$ which with respect to $S$ has a 
  block diagonal matrix such that each block on the diagonal is a 1-by-1 matrix containing 1 or -1 or is a 
  2-by-2 matrix of the form:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta & - \sin \theta \\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta
\end{pmatrix}
\quad \theta \in ( 0, \pi )
$$
