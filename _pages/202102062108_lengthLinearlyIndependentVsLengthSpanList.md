# Length of a Linearly Independent List vs Length of a Spanning List

The length of every [linearly independent](202102062030_linearlyIndependentDefinition) list is less than 
or equal to the length of a [spanning](202102062022_spanDefinition) list of vectors.

The proof works by iteratively adding each element from the linearly independent list to the other, 
first creating a linearly dependent list, and then removing one from the old spanning list using the [linear dependence lemma](202102062047_linearDependenceLemma).
