# Linearly Independent Definition

A list of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ is **linearly independent** if the only choice of values for
$a_1, \ldots, a_m \in \mathcal{F}$ that makes the expression $a_1 v_1 + \ldots + a_m v_m = 0$ is 
$a_1 = \ldots = a_m = 0$.

We define the empty list also as linearly independent.
