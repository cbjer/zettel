# Orthonormal List is Linearly Independent

Every list of [orthonormal](202102142052_orthonormalDefinition) vectors is [linearly indepdent](202102062038_linearlyDependentDefinition).

We can see this easily from [norm of an orthonormal linear combination result](202102142057_normOrthonormalLinearCombination)
