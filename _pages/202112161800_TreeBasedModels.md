# Tree Based Models

Remember tree based models can lead to high [variance](202103281546_biasVarianceTradeoffDerivation), as they can easily over fit to the data.

Examples of tree based methods include:
- [CART Algorithm](202112161612_CARTAlgorithm)
- [Regression Trees](202112161631_RegressionTrees)
- [Classification Trees](202112161745_ClassificationTrees)
- [Random Forest Model](202112171623_RandomForestModel)

Number of nodes is usually a hyperparameter.
