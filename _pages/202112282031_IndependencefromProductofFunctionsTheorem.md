# Independence from Product of Functions Theorem

Say want to show $X$ and $Y$ are [independent](202012241408_independence). Ie want to show

$$
p(x,y) = p(x)p(y)
$$

The theorem states if we can find separating functions $g$ and $h$ such that 
$$
f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)
$$
where $f$ is the probability density function, then the two random variables are **independent**.
