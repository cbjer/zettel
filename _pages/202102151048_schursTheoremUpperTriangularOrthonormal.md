# Schur's Theorem and Upper Triangular Matrix with Orthonormal Basis

If we have an [upper triangular](202102131604_upperTriangularMatrix) with respect to some 
basis, then we have an upper triangular matrix with respect to an [orthonormal basis](202102142105_orthonormalBasisDefinition).

**Schur's Theorem** says if we have a complex vector space, then $T$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some
orthonormal basis.

We can show the first part by saying, if we have an upper triangular matrix with respect to some basis, then this
is invariant under $T$ according to [equivalence of upper triangular result](202102131623_conditionsUpperTriangularMatrix). The applying
the [Gram-Schmidt procedure](202102142133_gramSchmidtProcedure) we get an orthonormal basis with the same span, thus must also 
be invariant under $T$ and therefore
