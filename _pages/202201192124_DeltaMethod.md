# Delta Method

Says that if we have a random variable which is approximately normal, then a function of this random variable is also normal

$$
\frac{\sqrt{n} (Y_n - \mu)}{\sigma} \xrightarrow{D} N(0,1) \\
\implies \\
\frac{\sqrt{n} (g(Y_n) - g(\mu))}{\vert g'(\mu) \vert \sigma} \xrightarrow{D} N(0,1)
$$

where $g'(\mu) \neq 0$.

Written nicer this says:
$$
Y_n \approx N(\mu, \frac{sigma^2}{n}) \implies g(Y_n) \approx N(g(\mu), (g'(\mu)^2 \frac{\sigma^2}{n}) 
$$

There is also a multivariate version
