# Gini Impurity

**Gini Impurity** or Gini Index intuitively tells us what is the probability of misclassifying an observation.

The lower the gini impurity, the less likely we are to misclassify and therefore the better the split.

For example, say I have a node with points belonging to one of $K$ classes and I pick a point at random. Then I am going to guess which class this belongs to by the distribution of points within the node. This is equivalent to saying what is the probability that I select the same class twice.

$$
GI = \sum_{k=1}^K P_k (1 - P_k) \\
GI = 1 - \sum_{k=1}^K P_k^2
$$
