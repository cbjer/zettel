# Minimal Polynomial Definition

Taking an operator $T$. The **minimal polynomial** of $T$ is the unique [monic polynomial](202104241842_monicPolynomialDefinition) 
$p$ of smallest degree such that $p(T) = 0$.

This is well defined due to [existence proof of a minimal polynomial](202104241849_existenceMinimalPolynomial).
