# Determinant of an Operator Definition

If we have an operator $T$, we define the **determinant** of $T$, $\mathrm{det} \, T$ as:
- If $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{C}$, then the determinant is the product of the [eigenvalues](202102120912_eigenvalueDefinition) 
  of $T$, with each eigenvalue repeated according to its [multiplicity](202104241520_multiplictyDefinitionEigenvalue)
- If $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}$, then the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues of $T_C$, the 
  [complexification](202104251532_complexificationOperator) of $T$, with each repeated according its 
  multiplicity.
