# Shrinkage

Regularization technique used in [boosting](202112161834_Boosting) based algorithms. Idea is to reduce the importance of the subsequent learners controlled by some parameter.

For the same number of boosting iterations, using higher shrinkage will result in higher training loss. Has been shown if use a high shrinkage value with more iterations can result in a better model than no shrinkage with less boosting iterations.
