# Orthogonal Complement

If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then the **Orthogonal Complement** of $U$, $U^{\bot}$, is the set of all
vectors in $V$ which are [orthogonal](202102141725_orthogonalDefinition) to every vector in $U$.
$$
U^{\bot} = \{ v \in V : \langle v,u \rangle = 0 \, \textrm{for every} \, u \in U \}
$$

It has the [following basic properties](202102151808_propertiesOrthogonalComplement)
