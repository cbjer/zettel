# Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

Akaike Information Criterion (more commonly AIC) is a measure used to assess the relative performance of models being fitted to some data. 
It aims to measure how much information is lost from the data by using a specific choice of model. We say if we have $k$ estimated or 
fitted parameters and $\hat{L}$ as the maximum likelyhood using the model, then the AIC is defined as:

$$
\textrm{AIC} = 2 k - 2 \ln ( \hat{L} )
$$

We choose the model with the minimum AIC.
