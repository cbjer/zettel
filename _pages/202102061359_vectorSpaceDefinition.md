# Vector Space Definition

A vector space is a set $V$ along with a addition on $V$ and a scalar multiplication on $V$ such that
the following properties hold:

- Commutativity $\quad u + v = v + u$
- Associativity $\quad (u + v) + w = u + (v + w)$
- Additive identity $\quad \exists 0 : v + 0 = v$
- Additive inverse $\quad \exists w : v + w = 0$
- multiplicative identity $\quad \exists 1 \in F : 1 v = v$
- Scalars distributative $\quad a ( v + w ) = a v + a w$

Basic Properties:
- Identity is unique
- Additive inverse is unique
