# Dimension of the Orthogonal Complement

If we want the [dimension](202102062253_dimensionDefinition) of the [orthogonal complement](202102151112_orthogonalComplementDefinition) of $U$,
$$
\mathrm{dim} \, U^{\bot} = \mathrm{dim} \, V - \mathrm{dim} \, U
$$

This is easily seen from [dimension of a direct sum result](202102151834_dimensionDirectSum)
