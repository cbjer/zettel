# Linearly Independent Eigenvectors

If we have a [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T$ with **distinct** [eigenvalues](202102120912_eigenvalueDefinition) 
$\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m$ of $T$ with corresponding [eigenvectors](202102120943_eigenvectorDefinition) 
$v_1, \ldots, v_m$, then these eigenvectors are [linearly independent](202102062030_linearlyIndependentDefinition).

Immediate from this is that the numbers of distinct eigenvalues, is at most $\textrm{dim} \, V$. If had more than would have
a linearly independent set of vectors larger than a [basis](202102062252_basisLength).
