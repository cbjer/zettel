# Basic Properties of the Orthogonal Complement

The [orthogonal complement](202102151112_orthogonalComplementDefinition) has the following properties:
- If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U^{\bot}$ is a [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) of $V$
- $\{ 0 \}^{\bot} = V$
- $V^{\bot} = \{ 0 \}$
- If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U \cap U^{\bot} \subset \{ 0 \}$ 
- If $U$ and $W$ are subsets of $V$ and $U \subset W$ then $W^{\bot} \subset U^{\bot}$
