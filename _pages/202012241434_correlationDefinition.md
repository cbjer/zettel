# Correlation Definition

We use correlation as a unitless measure of [covariance](202012221554_covarianceDefinition), restricted to the $[-1,1]$ interal.

$$
\rho_{X Y} = \frac{\sigma^2_{X Y}}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}
$$

Note the numerator uses a covariance whereas as the denominator is the two [variances](202012241415_varianceDefinition).
