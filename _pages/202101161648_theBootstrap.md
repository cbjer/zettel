# The Bootrap

The Bootstrap method is used to estimate statistical properties of a distribution without having to sample new data points from the distribution. The 
general idea is to take our 1 data sample and to sample with replacement from this data sample, calculating a [statistical estimator](202012241539_estimatorDefinition) 
on each sample. Combining these estimates allows us to calculate statistics on the estimator, for example a [confidence interval](TODOs).
