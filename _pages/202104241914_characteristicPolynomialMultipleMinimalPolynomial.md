# Characteristic Polynomial is a multiple of Minimal Polynomial

If we are in a complex field, with operator $T$, then the [characteristic polynomial](202104241811_characteristicPolynomialDefinition)
of $T$ is a [polynomial multiple](202104241915_polynomialMultipleDefinition) of the 
[minimal polynomial](202104241845_minimalPolynomialDefinition) of $T$.

Follows from [zero polynomial result](202104241858_zeroPolynomialImpliesMultipleMinimalPolynomial) and [Cayley-Hamilton](202104241825_cayleyHamiltonTheorem).

Implies also that the degree of the minimal polynomial of $T$ is at most $\mathrm{dim} \, V$.

The result also applies for real vector spaces.
