# Transformation Sampling Technique

Technique simply says that we can simulate from a random variable $Y$ if we can find a function
$\phi(x)$ such that $Y = \phi(X)$ and $X$ is a random variable that we can already sample from.

The most famous example of this method is the [Box-Muller Method](202101101214_boxMullerMethod) for sampling 
from a normal distribution.
