# Fisher Information

The Fisher Information / Expected Information is the expected [information matrix](202111211330_InformationMatrix)

$$
\mathbf{i}(\theta) = \mathrm{E}_{\mathbf{x}} [\mathbf{I}(\theta)]
$$

Ie the randomness due to our data from $X$ has been averaged out. 

It can be shown to be equivalent to the variance of the [score function](202111211323_ScoreFunction).
