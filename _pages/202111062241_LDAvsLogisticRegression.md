# LDA vs Logistic Regression

Some of the differences between the approaches:
- In [logistic regression](202011221613_logisticRegression) we do not make any assumption on $p(X)$, and we are technically maximising the conditional likelyhood.
- In [LDA](202111062039_LinearDiscriminantAnalysis) we maximise the full log likelyhood based on an assume form for the joint density.
- LDA is not robust to gross outliers due to the estimation of the covariance matrix.
- Logistic regression generally seen as better choice which makes less assumptions.
