# Triangle Inequality

For $u, v \in V$ then
$$
\Vert u + v \Vert \leq \Vert u \Vert + \Vert v \Vert
$$

With the equality being an equality **if and only if** one of the $u, v$ is a non-negative multiple of the other.

We show this via expanding the LH [norm](202102141717_normDefinition) expression, using [basic properties of inner products](202102141654_innerProductDefinition) and the 
[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality](202102141737_cauchySchwarzInequality).
