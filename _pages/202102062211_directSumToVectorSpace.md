# Every Subspace Has a Direct Sum Forming V

If $U$ is a [subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) of the [vector space](202102061359_vectorSpaceDefinition) $V$, then there
exists some subspace $W$ forming a [direct sum](202102061512_directSumDefinition) with $U$ to form $V$. Ie
$$
V = U \oplus W
$$
