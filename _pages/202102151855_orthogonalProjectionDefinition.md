# Orthogonal Projection Definition

If we have $U$ as a finite dimensional subspace of $V$, the **orthogonal projection** of $V$ onto $U$ is the [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition)
$P_U \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ defined by 
- for $v \in V$, write $v = u + w$ where $u \in U$ and $w \in U^{\bot}$ 
- Then define $P_U v = u$

This is well defined as $V$ is a [direct sum between $U$ and its orthogonal complement](202102151815_directSumOrthogonalComplement)

We have the [following properties of an orthogonal projection](202102151928_propertiesOrthogonalProjection)
