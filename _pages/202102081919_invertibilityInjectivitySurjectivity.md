# Invertibility Equivalence to Injectivity and Surjectivity

A [linear map](202102071416_linearMapDefinition) is [invertible](202102081851_invertibleMap) if and only if 
it is [injective](202102071749_injectiveDefinition) and [surjective](202102071809_surjectiveDefinition)

$T$ invertible $\iff$ $T$ injective and surjective
