# Boosting

In boosting we start with a simple model and iteratively add further models to create a strong learner. This is often done on residuals or gradient residuals. 

Example models include:
- [AdaBoost](202112161827_AdaBoostModel)
- [Gradient Boosting](202112161853_GradientBoosting)

Boosting generally starts with a high [bias](202103281546_biasVarianceTradeoffDerivation) model (a simple one) and succesively adds learners to reduce this bias and create a strong model.

Often a hyperparameter of how many boosting iterations there should be.
