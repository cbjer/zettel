# Cubic Spline

A **Cubic Spline** is an interpolation technique where we split our data into regions and fit a cubic polynomial within each of these regions (piecewise). 

We call these start and end points of the regions, the **knots**. Selecting them is difficult. 

We then impose restrictions:
- The overall function must be continuous (each piecewise cubic starts where the previous finished)
- The first derivative is continuous at the region end points
- The second derivative is continuous at the region end points

There also some other range of boundary conditions which can be imposed.

For example, the **natural spline** boundary condition imposes that the second derivative at the overall start and end point are $0$.
