# Trace of an Operator

Say $T$ is an operator, then we define the **trace** by:

- If $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{C}$, then the trace of $T$ is the sum of [eigenvalues](202102120912_eigenvalueDefinition) of $T$, with
each eigenvalue repeated according to its [multiplicity](202104241520_multiplictyDefinitionEigenvalue).
- If $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}$, then the trace of $T$ is the sum of the eigenvalues of $T_C$, the [complexification](202104251532_complexificationOperator) of
$T$, with each eigenvalue repeated according to its multiplicity.

Denoted as $\mathrm{trace} \, T$.
