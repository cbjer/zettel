# Equality in the Sequence of Null Spaces

If we have an [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T$, and there is a non-negative integer $m$ such that $\textrm{null} \, T^m = \textrm{null} \, T^{m+1}$, then
$$
\textrm{null} \, T^m = \textrm{null} \, T^{m+1} = \textrm{null} \, T^{m+2} = \cdots
$$

Ie, all [null-spaces](202102071742_nullSpaceDefinition) from that point onwards are also equal.
