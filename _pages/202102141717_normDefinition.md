# Norm Definition

For a vector $v \in V$, we define the **norm** of $v$, denoted as $\Vert v \Vert$, as defined by:
$$
\Vert v \Vert = \sqrt{\langle v, v \rangle} \\
\Vert v \Vert^2 = \langle v, v \rangle
$$

Ie the square root of the [inner product](202102141654_innerProductDefinition) with itself.

I think technically this is called the Euclidean Norm.
