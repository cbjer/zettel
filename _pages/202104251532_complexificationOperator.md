# Complexification of an Operator

If we have $V$ a real vector space and $T$ an [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) on $V$, then the 
[complexification](202104251520_complexificationOfV) of $T$, denoted $T_C$, is defined as the operator 
$T_C \in \mathcal{L}(V_C)$ defined by
$$
T_C(u + i v) = T u + i T v \\
u, v \in V
$$
