# Trace of an Operator Equals Trace of its Matrix

If we have an operator $T$, then $\mathrm{trace} \, T = \mathrm{trace} \, \mathcal{M} (T)$.

Essentially our two definitions, [trace of an operator](202104292131_traceOperatorDefinition) and [trace of a matrix](202104292137_traceMatrixDefinition) 
are equivalent.
