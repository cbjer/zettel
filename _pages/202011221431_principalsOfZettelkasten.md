# Principals of Zettelkasten

- Create small notes with each node having exactly 1 idea on it.
- Each note should not be more than a few sentences.
- Create dense links between your different notes. But these links need to be precise.
- Do not worry about creating deep structure to your notes from the start. 
- More important to concentrate on linking notes together.
- Dont need everything sorted into hubs
- Actively go back through notes adding in new links
