# Matrix of the Identity with respect to two Basis

Suppose $u_1, \ldots, u_n$ and $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ are bases of $V$. Then the matrices $\mathcal{M}(I, (u_1, \ldots, u_n), (v_1, \ldots, v_n) )$
and $\mathcal{M}(I, (v_1, \ldots, v_n), (u_1, \ldots, u_n) )$ are [invertible](202104292059_invertibleMatrixDefinition) and each 
is the inverse of the other.
