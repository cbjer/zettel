# Characterisation of Normal Operators when $\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}$

If we have $V$ a real [inner product space](202102141708_innerProductSpace) and $T$ an operator, then the following 
are equivalent:
- $T$ is [normal](202102162200_normalOperatorDefinition)
- There is an [orthonormal basis](202102142105_orthonormalBasisDefinition) of $V$ which respect to which $T$ has 
  a [block diagonal matrix](202104241535_blockDiagonalMatrixDefinition) such that each block is a 1-by-1 matrix or a 
  2-by-2 matrix of the form
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}
\quad b > 0
$$
