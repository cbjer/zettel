# Determinant is Multiplicative

If we have square matrices of the same size, then 
$$
\textrm{det} (AB) = \textrm{det}(BA) = ( \textrm{det} A ) ( \textrm{det} B )
$$

Since the [two definitions of determinant are the same](202105091856_determinantOperatorEqualsDeterminantMatrix), 
the result also holds for determinants of operators.
