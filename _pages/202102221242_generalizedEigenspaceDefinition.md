# Generalized Eigenspace Definition

If we have an [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T$ and $\lambda \in \mathbf{F}$, then the 
**generalized eigenspace** of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$, denoted $G(\lambda, T)$ is defined to be 
the set of all [generalized eigenvectors](202102221239_generalizedEigenvectorDefinition) of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$,
along with the $0$ vector.
