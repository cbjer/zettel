# Classification Trees

Methodology is exactly the same as for [regression trees](202112161631_RegressionTrees) except that we use a different cost function (since square error would not make sense).

These can be for example [Gini Impurity](202112161744_GiniImpurity) or [cross entropy](202103271307_crossEntropy).

Remember the features will be of the same form as in the regression setting, so we still use the same methodology for finding the splitting points.
