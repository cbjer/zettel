# Basis Definition

A **basis** of a [vector space](202102061359_vectorSpaceDefinition) is a list of vectors in $V$ that are
[linearly independent](202102062030_linearlyIndependentDefinition) and [span](202102062022_spanDefinition) $V$.

A criterion for a list of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ being a basis if and only if every $v \in V$ can 
be written **uniquely** in the form $$v = a_1 v_1 + \ldots + a_n v_n$$

Every finite dimensional vector space has a basis
