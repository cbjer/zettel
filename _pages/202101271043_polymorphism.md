# Polymorphism

In programming, polymorphism is the concept that an object can be treated as a generic version of another version. This 
is usually achieved through an object implementing some interface.

For example if we have a method which accepts a "Shape" object, we can input a "Circle" or "Square" object which are implementations of the "Shape" object.

Code example:

```java
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Object stringObject = "hi there";
    Object numberObject = 12;

    printMe(stringObject);
    printMe(numberObject);
  }

  public static void printMe(Object obj) {
    System.out.println(obj);
  }
}
// hi there
// 12
```
