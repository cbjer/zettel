# Mental Multiplication with Bases Trick

Say we are trying to multiply two numbers together $x$ and $y$.

We choose some base $B$ to compare the two numbers over.

We can then write
$$
x = B + \hat{x} \\
y = B + \hat{y}
$$

Then it is simple to show that 
$$
x \cdot y = B ( x + \hat{y} ) + \hat{x} \cdot \hat{y}
$$

Examples:

- $\mathbf{14 \cdot 17}$, choose a base of $10$, we have $4$ and $7$ over the base. $4 + 17 = 21$, multipled by the base $210$, add the multiplication of $28$ gets us $238$.
