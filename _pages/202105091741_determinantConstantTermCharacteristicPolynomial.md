# Determinant and Constant Term in Characteristic Polynomial

If we let $n = \textrm{dim} \, n$, then the [determinant](202105091734_determinantOperatorDefinition) of $T$
equals $(-1)^n$ times the constant term in the [characteristic polynomial](202104241811_characteristicPolynomialDefinition)
of $T$.
