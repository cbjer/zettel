# Bayes Rule

Bayes Rule is easily derived from the [definition of conditional probability](202012221446_definitionConditionalProbability).

$$
P ( A | B ) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

Using a partition of the event space $A_i$, we can also write this as 

$$
P ( A_k | B ) = \frac{P(B|A_k) P(A_k)}{\sum_i P (B | A_i) P(A_i)}
$$
