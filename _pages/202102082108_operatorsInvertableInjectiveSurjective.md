# Equivalence of Invertability, Injectivity and Surjectivity for Operators

Suppose $V$ is [finite dimensional](202102062028_finiteDimensionalVectorSpace) and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ an [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) 
then the following are equivalent
- $T$ is [invertible](202102081851_invertibleMap)
- T is [injective](202102071749_injectiveDefinition)
- T is [surjective](202102071809_surjectiveDefinition)
