# The Norm of an Orthonormal Linear Combination

If we have $e_1, \ldots, e_m$ as an [orthonormal](202102142052_orthonormalDefinition) list of vectors in $V$ then 
$$
\Vert a_1 e_1 + \cdots a_m e_m \Vert^2 = \vert a_1 \vert^2 + \cdots + \vert a_m \vert^2 
$$

We can see this easily from repeated applying of [pythagorean theorem](202102141728_pythagoreanLinearAlgebra).
