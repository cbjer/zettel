# Q-Learning

Q-Learning is an [off-policy](202011301312_offPolicyMethods) Temporal Difference based [control](TODOs) algorithm. 

The algorithm is sometimes called "SARSAMAX" due to changing the update step to be a max over the state-action values 
for the next state. It is described as off-policy due to the subsequenct action decided by the hard maximisation over actions, 
rather than inferred directly from the existing policy, which is usually [epsilon-greedy](202011301251_epsilonGreedyPolicy) with 
respect to the state-action value function.
