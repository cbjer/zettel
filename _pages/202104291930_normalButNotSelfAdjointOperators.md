# Normal but not Self-Adjoint Operators

If we have $V$ as a 2-dimensional real [inner product space](202102141708_innerProductSpace) and $T$ an operator, 
then the following are equivalent:

- $T$ is [normal](202102162200_normalOperatorDefinition) but not [self-adjoint](202102162040_selfAdjointOperator)
- The matrix of $T$ with respect to every [orthonormal basis](202102142105_orthonormalBasisDefinition) of $V$ has the form:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix} 
\quad b \neq 0
$$
- The matrix of $T$ with respect to some orthonormal basis of $V$ has the form:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & -b \\
b & a
\end{pmatrix}
\quad b > 0
$$
