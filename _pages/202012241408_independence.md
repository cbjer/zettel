# Independence Definition

Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the probability of them both occuring is their probabilitities 
multiplied together. Intuitively we can think of as the outcome of one event is in no way dependent on the 
outcome of the other.

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

If working with probability density functions this is

$$
f_{X Y}(x, y) = f_X(x) \, f_Y(y)
$$
