# Multiplying Two 2-Digit Numbers Quickly

Say we have two two digit numbers $ab$ and $cd$ to multiply together. Don't think of the 10s aspect in the multiplication but take 

$$
ac | (ad + bc) | bd 
$$

as the three parts, allowing any excess to carry over into the next

Example

$$38 \cdot 19 \rightarrow \big[ | 3 | 27+8 | 72 \big] \rightarrow \big[ | 3 | 42 | 2 \big] \rightarrow 722$$
