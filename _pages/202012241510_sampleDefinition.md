# Random Sample Definition

A random sample is a collection of $n$ random variables \{ $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ \} which are [independent](202012241408_independence)
and identically distributed with $X$. Again we stress it is a collection of random variables and not just $n$ observations of $X$.

Since they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), we can write the joint density function as

$$
f_{X_1, \dots, X_n}(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \prod^n_{i=1} f_X(x_i)
$$
where $f_X(x)$ is our density function for $X$.
