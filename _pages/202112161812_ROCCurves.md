# ROC Curves

Curve which assesses the tradeoff between [sensitivity and specificity](202112161806_SensitivityandSpecificity).

Only used in binary (2-class) classification problems.

We actually plot sensitivty vs (1 - specificity), in other words true positive vs false positive. 

What is being varied to create the curve is the **probability threshold** in which we assign to the positive class. Eg, only if the model says 80% probability of belonging to positive, do we assign to the positive class.

Common metric to evaluate which is a better model is the area under the ROC Curve.
