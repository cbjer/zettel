# Direct Sum Definition

Say we have [subspaces](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) $U_1, \ldots, U_m$ of $V$. Then we call the [sum](202102061453_sumOfSubsetsDefinition)
$U_1 + \ldots + U_m$ a **direct sum** if
- Each element of $U_1 + \ldots + U_m$ can be written **in only one way** as a sum $u_1 + \ldots + u_m$ where each $u_j \in U_j$

We use the notation $U_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus U_m$ to denote the sum as a direct sum
