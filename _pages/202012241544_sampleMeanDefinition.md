# Sample Mean Definition

The sample mean is an [estimator](202012241539_estimatorDefinition) for the true mean of $X$, using a 
[random sample](202012241510_sampleDefinition) of $X$, \{ $X_1, \dots, X_n$ \} as input.

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

Taking expectations of $\bar{X}$, we can easily show the sample mean is an [unbiased estimator](202012241553_biasDefinition) for the true mean of $X$.
