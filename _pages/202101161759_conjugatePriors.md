# Conjugate Priors

A Conjugate prior for a given [likelyhood](202101091603_probabilityLikelyhood) is one in which the prior and [posterior](202101161711_bayesianInference) 
are from the same probability distribution family. 

For example if we take a Binomial likelyhood with a Beta prior, we get a posterior which is also from the Beta family.

An advantage of conjugate priors, is that it avoids the need to integrate the posterior which can often be a computationally complex problem.
