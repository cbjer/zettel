# Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

Very similiar to [linear discriminant analysis](202111062039_LinearDiscriminantAnalysis), except we do not assume each covariance matrix is equal. Ie we do not assume $\Sigma_k = \Sigma$.

This creates a quadratic decision boundary between the classes.

We also have regularized discriminant analysis which sits between the linear and quadratic forms.
