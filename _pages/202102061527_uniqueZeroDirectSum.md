# Unique Zero for a Direct Sum Condition

We can show a [sum](202102061453_sumOfSubsetsDefinition) is a [direct sum](202102061512_directSumDefinition) by showing that 
the only way to write $\mathbf{0}$ as a sum $u_1 + \ldots + u_m$ is where each $u_j$ is $0$. 

This is an equivalence / if and only if condition.
