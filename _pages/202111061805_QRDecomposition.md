# QR Decomposition

Says we can decompose any real square matrix $A$ into

$$
A = QR
$$

where $Q$ is an [orthogonal](202102141725_orthogonalDefinition) matrix (ie its columns are [orthonormal](202102142052_orthonormalDefinition)) and $R$ is an [upper triangular matrix](202102131604_upperTriangularMatrix).

Note for an orthogonal matrix $Q^T Q = I$ since we are applying the dot product to each vector, and thus $Q^{-1} = Q^T$, the inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose.
