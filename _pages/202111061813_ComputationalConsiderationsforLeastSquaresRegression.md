# Computational Considerations for Least Squares Regression

When solving [least squares regression](202103141315_linearRegressionMatrixSolution), we require to compute $(X^TX)^{-1}$ which is usually achieved via either:
- [Cholesky Decomposition](202111061758_CholeskyDecomposition)
- [QR Decomposition](202111061805_QRDecomposition)
