# Cholesky Decomposition

**Cholesky Decomposition** is the decomposition of a [self-adjoint](202102162040_selfAdjointOperator), [positive definite](202101091703_positiveDefiniteMatrix) matrix into the product of a [lower triangular matrix](202102131604_upperTriangularMatrix) and its [conjugate transpose](202102162035_conjugateTransposeDefinition).

$$
A = L L^*
$$

where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries and $L^*$ is the conjugate transpose.

If $A$ is a real matrix, then we are saying every symmetric positive definite matrix has a unique Cholesky decomposition.
