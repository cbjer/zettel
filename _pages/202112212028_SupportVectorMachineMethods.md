# Support Vector Machine Methods

Examples include:
- [Support Vector Classifier](202112212024_SupportVectorClassifier)
- [Non-Separable Support Vector Classifier](202112212147_NonSeparableSupportVectorClassifier)
- [Kernel Space](202112212026_KernelSpaces)

One positive is usually not impacted by outliers, eg only affected by the support vectors.
