# Model-free Reinforcement Learning

In Model-Free Reinforcement Learning, we do not have a separate model of 
the environment which we use for learning, as opposed to the approach used in 
[model-based reinforcement learning](202012012352_modelBasedRL).

This is sometimes called "Direct Reinforcement Learning", since we do 
not have a model of the environment to base our policy off, we have to learn 
directly from actual experience from the environment.
