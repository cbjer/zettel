# Complexified Operator has Same Matrix

If we have a [complexified operator](202104251532_complexificationOperator) $T_C$ and a basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ for the
real vector space $V$, then $\mathcal{M}(T) = \mathcal{M}(T_C)$. 

Ie their [matrix representation](202102072233_matrixLinearMap) is equal
with both matrices being with respect to the basis $v_1, \ldots, v_n$.
