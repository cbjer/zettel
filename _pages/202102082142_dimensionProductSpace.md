# Dimension of a Product Space

If we have a [product space](202102082137_productSpace) $V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m$, then this space is
finite dimensional and obeys:
$$
\mathrm{dim} (V_1 \times \cdots \times V_m ) = \mathrm{dim} \, V_1 + \cdots + \mathrm{dim} \, V_m
$$

We also have that result of [dimension of a direct sum](202102151834_dimensionDirectSum)
