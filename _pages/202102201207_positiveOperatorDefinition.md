# Positive Operator Definition

An [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T$ is called **positive** if $T$ is [self-adjoint](202102162040_selfAdjointOperator) 
and
$$
\langle T v , v \rangle \geq 0 \\
\textrm{for all} \, v \in V
$$

Note some references also use the name **positive semi-definite operator** for a positive operator.

We have the following [equivalences for positive operators](202102201218_equivalencesPositiveOperator)
