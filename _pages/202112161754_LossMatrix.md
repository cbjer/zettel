# Loss Matrix

Say we have $M$ different classes $[K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_M]$. The loss matrix $k_{i,j}$ gives the loss associated with classifying category $K_i$ as $K_j$.

This ofcourse does not need to be symmetric (perhaps worse to classify someone with a disease as not having it than vice versa).
