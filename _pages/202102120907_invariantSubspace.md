# Invariant Subspace

If we have [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$, then we say that a 
[subspace](202102061429_subspaceDefinition) $U$ is **invariant** under $T$ if whenever $u \in U$ means that the mapping of $u$,
$Tu$, is also a member of $U$.
$$
u \in U \implies Tu \in U
$$
