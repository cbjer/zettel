# Unique Linear Map from Basis of Domain

If we have a [basis](202102062154_basisDefinition) $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ of $V$ and vectors $w_1, \ldots, w_m \in W$, then we have a
unique [linear map](202102071416_linearMapDefinition) $T : V \rightarrow W$ such that we map each basis vector to 
the corresponding vector in $W$. Ie that
$$
T v_j = w_j \quad \textrm{for each} \, 1 \leq j \leq m
$$
