# Trajectory Sampling

Trajectory Sampling is an alternative method of [planning](202012012357_rlPlanning) as 
compared to the uniform sampling which occurs in the planning done by [Dyna-Q](202012020018_tabularDynaQ).

The advantage here is that we are ignoring uninsteresting parts of 
the state space.
