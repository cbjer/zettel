# Degree and Zeros of Characteristic Polynomial for Real Operator

If we have $V$ a real vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ then:

- The coefficients of the [characteristic polynomial](202104262156_characteristicPolynomialRealOperatorDefinition) of $T$ are real
- characteristic polynomial of $T$ has degree $\mathrm{dim} \, V$
- The [eigenvalues](202102120912_eigenvalueDefinition) of $T$ are precisely the real zeros of the characteristic polynomial of T
