# Positive Definite Matrix

A **positive definite matrix** is a symmetric matrix $M$ which has the property that for all non-zero $y$,

$$
y^T M y > 0 \quad \forall y \neq 0
$$

A **positive semi-definite matrix** relaxes the condition to be **greater than or equal to zero** for all $y$. Ie
$$
y^T M y \geq 0 \quad \forall y
$$
