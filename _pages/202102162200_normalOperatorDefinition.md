# Normal Operator Definition

An [operator](202102082104_operatorDefinition) on an [inner product space](202102141708_innerProductSpace) is called **normal** 
if it commutes with its [adjoint](202102161843_adjointDefinition).

Ie $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal if:
$$
T \, T^* = T^* \, T
$$

Clearly if an operator is [self-adjoint](202102162040_selfAdjointOperator), then it is also normal.
