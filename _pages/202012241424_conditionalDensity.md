# Conditional Density Definition

We define the conditional density function $f_{X|Y}(x)$ as 

$$
f_{X|Y}(x) = \frac{f_{X Y}(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}
$$

That it is the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ divided by the marginal distribution of $Y$, in exactly the same
relation as in the [definition of conditional probability](202012221446_definitionConditionalProbability) except with density 
functions.
